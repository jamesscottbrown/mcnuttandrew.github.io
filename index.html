<h3>PhD Student in Visualization</h3>
<p>
  My name is Andrew McNutt, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My work focuses on information visualization in general, and on automated guidance systems (like linters), unusual or xenographical data visualizations, and web applications as a visualization medium specifically.
