I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My work falls in the intersection of Data Visualization and HCI. 

<br/>

I'm interested in theories of visualization (and finding opportunities for the operationalization of those ideas), as well as the design of user interfaces for knowledge-based tasks (such as visual analytics and creative coding) with an eye towards leveraging tools from programming languages and software engineering in those designs.  

<br/>
In the near past I worked as a Data Visualization Engineer for a variety of companies in San Francisco. 
I got a formal education in physics from Reed College in Portland, and an informal education in web development from App Academy. 
I am a fan of deserts, buffalo, and bicycles.

I'm always happy to chat about all/any of these topics! Drop me a line by email (mcnutt AT uchicago DOT edu) or on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/_mcnutt_/">@_mcnutt_</a>).
